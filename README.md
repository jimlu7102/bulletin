# "bulletin"
To replace "contract" with "bulletin" for a kinds of general application.
“contract” is limited to transfer value app only. This effort is to replace the word “contract” from Ethereum community usage， to build a branch of a brand new small scale block-chain community: “bulletin” community，to meet the “verified records" requirements, for stable, dynamic community application tool sets 
Under the smart "bulletin", the function or methods should be executed to verify： 1, if it is valid； 2, whether it is conflicts with an occupied "seat” or rule sets；3，if the seat requested is available，publish in the “bulletin” for legal reservation.
The “seats” can be a three D space or moving space.
If the "space" time out, a mining or fade-a-way house-clean is desired to eliminate un-necessary overloaded historical data.
The "space" can be transfer from one theater to another theater, "bulletin" can be arranged to neighbors.
Well come everyone to contribute to the project.
